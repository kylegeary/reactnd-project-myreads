# MyReads Project

This is a react-based book tracking app that allows users to store their selected books in one of three digital bookshelves (want to read, currently reading, and read).

## TL;DR

To get started developing right away:

* Clone this respository onto your local environment using `git clone https://github.com/kylegeary/reactnd-project-myreads.git`
* Install all project dependencies with either `npm install` or `yarn add` (Learn more about yarn here: https://yarnpkg.com/en/)
* Start the development server with either `npm start` or `yarn start`

Remember! In React it is a best practice to create new JS files for each component and to use import/require statements in order to include them where they are needed.

## Backend Server
The provided [`BooksAPI.js`](src/BooksAPI.js) file has all of the methods you'll need to perform necessary operations on the backend:

* [`getAll`](#getall)
* [`update`](#update)
* [`search`](#search)

### `getAll`

Method Signature:

```js
getAll()
```

* Returns a Promise which resolves to a JSON object containing a collection of book objects.
* This collection represents the books currently in the bookshelves in your app.

### `update`

Method Signature:

```js
update(book, shelf)
```

* book: `<Object>` containing at minimum an `id` attribute
* shelf: `<String>` contains one of ["wantToRead", "currentlyReading", "read"]
* Returns a Promise which resolves to a JSON object containing the response data of the POST request

### `search`

Method Signature:

```js
search(query)
```

* query: `<String>`
* Returns a Promise which resolves to a JSON object containing a collection of a maximum of 20 book objects.
* These books do not know which shelf they are on. They are raw results only. You'll need to make sure that books have the correct state while on the search page.

## Important
The backend API uses a fixed set of cached search results and is limited to a particular set of search terms, which can be found in [SEARCH_TERMS.md](SEARCH_TERMS.md). That list of terms are the _only_ terms that will work with the backend, so don't be surprised if your searches for Basket Weaving or Bubble Wrap don't come back with any results.

## Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app). You can find more information on how to perform common tasks [here](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md).
